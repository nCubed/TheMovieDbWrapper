# TheMovieDb.org Wrapper
TheMovieDbWrapper is a C# wrapper for [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org) API providing cross-platform support for Xamarin, iOS, Android, and all flavors of .NET.

A nuget package is available directly through Visual Studio: https://www.nuget.org/packages/TheMovieDbWrapper/

##### Common Requests
The current release supports common requests for movie and other miscellaneous information, such as:
* themoviedb.org configuration information
* Movie information
* Movie rating information
* TV show information
* Movie and TV genres
* Movie/TV industry specific professions
* Production company information
* People information

## Usage - Setup
In order to use any feature of the wrapper, a concrete implementation of the [IMovieDbSettings](DM.MovieApi/IMovieDbSettings.cs) interface must be created. The interface only contains 2 properties:

1. ApiKey: a private key required to query [themoviedb.org API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
2. ApiUrl: the URL used for api calls to themoviedb.org. This URL should be static, but is included in case an alternative URL is ever provided. The current URL is `http://api.themoviedb.org/3/`

Once the `IMovieDbSettings` interface has been implemented, it can be used to register your settings with the `MovieDbFactory`.

_Note_: There is an overloaded method on the `MovieDbFactory` which allows you to register your settings as parameters to the method.

### Usage - MovieDbFactory
The `MovieDbFactory` provides access to all exposed operations for retrieving information from themoviedb.org. The factory exposes the following methods (other methods may be exposed, but these are the important ones):
* `void MovieDbFactory.RegisterSettings( IMovieDbSettings settings )`: Registers your themoviedb.org specific API key with the factory.
* `void MovieDbFactory.RegisterSettings( string apiKey, string apiUrl = "http://api.themoviedb.org/3/" )`: Registers your themoviedb.org specific API key with the factory.
* `Lazy<T> MovieDbFactory.Create<T>() where T : IApiRequest`: Creates the specific API requested. See below (Usages - Interfaces) for all exposed interfaces. One of the `RegisterSettings` methods must be called prior to creating anything from the factory.

### Usage - Interfaces
The following interfaces can be used to retrieve information:
* [`IApiConfigurationRequest`](DM.MovieApi/MovieDb/Configuration/IApiConfigurationRequest.cs): Provides access for retrieving themoviedb.org configuration information.
* [`IApiMovieRequest`](DM.MovieApi/MovieDb/Movies/IApiMovieRequest.cs): Provides access for retrieving information about Movies.
* [`IApiMovieRatingRequest`](DM.MovieApi/MovieDb/Certifications/IApiMovieRatingRequest.cs): Provides access for retrieving movie rating information.
* [`IApiTVShowRequest`](DM.MovieApi/MovieDb/TV/IApiTVShowRequest.cs): Provides access for retrieving information about TV shows.
* [`IApiGenreRequest`](DM.MovieApi/MovieDb/Genres/IApiGenreRequest.cs): Provides access for retrieving Movie and TV genres.
* [`IApiCompanyRequest`](DM.MovieApi/MovieDb/Companies/IApiCompanyRequest.cs): Provides access for retrieving production company information.
* [`IApiProfessionRequest`](DM.MovieApi/MovieDb/IndustryProfessions/IApiProfessionRequest.cs): Provides access for retrieving information about Movie/TV industry specific professions.
* [`IApiPeopleRequest`](DM.MovieApi/MovieDb/People/IApiPeopleRequest.cs): Provides access for retrieving information about People.

### Usage - Examples
Register your settings first:
```csharp
// registration with an implementation of IMovieDbSettings
//, i.e., public class YourMovieDbSettings : IMoveDbSettings { // implementation }
MovieDbFactory.RegisterSettings( new YourMovieDbSettings() )

// alternative method of registration
MovieDbFactory.RegisterSettings( "your-apiKey", "http://api.themoviedb.org/3/" )
```

Retrieve an API request interface (see Usage - Interfaces above for available interfaces):
```csharp
// as the factory returns a Lazy<T> instance, simply grab the Value out of the Lazy<T>
// and assign to a local variable.
var movieApi = MovieDbFactory.Create<IApiMovieRequest>().Value
```

Use the API request interface to retrieve information:
```csharp
ApiSearchResponse<MovieInfo> response = await _api.SearchByTitleAsync( "Star Trek" );
```

The [`ApiSearchResponse<T>`](DM.MovieApi/ApiResponse/ApiSearchResponse.cs) provides rich information about the results of the search:
* `IReadOnlyList<T> Results`: The list of results from the search.
* `int PageNumber`: The current page number of the search result.
* `int TotalPages`: The total number of pages found from the search result.
* `int TotalResults`: The total number of results from the search.
* `ToString()`: returns "Page x of y (z total results)".
* `ApiError Error`: Contains specific error information if an error was encountered during the API call to themoviedb.org.
* `ApiRateLimit RateLimit`: Contains the current rate limits from your most recent API call to themoviedb.org.

Other methods querying on specific Id's, such as `IApiMovieRequest.FindByIdAsync( movieId )` will return an [`ApiQueryResponse<T>`](DM.MovieApi/ApiResponse/ApiQueryResponse.cs) with a single result as well as some common information seen in the `ApiSearchResponse`:
* `T Item`: The item returned from the API call, where T is the specific query such as `MovieInfo`, `Movie`, `MovieCredit`, etc..
* `ToString()`: returns the ToString method of the Item.
* `ApiError Error`: Contains specific error information if an error was encountered during the API call to themoviedb.org.
* `ApiRateLimit RateLimit`: Contains the current rate limits from your most recent API call to themoviedb.org.

#### Usage - Examples: Putting it all together
```csharp
// RegisterSettings only needs to be called one time when your application starts-up.
MovieDbFactory.RegisterSettings( new YourMovieDbSettings() )

var movieApi = MovieDbFactory.Create<IApiMovieRequest>().Value;

ApiSearchResponse<MovieInfo> response = await movieApi.SearchByTitleAsync( "Star Trek" );

foreach( MovieInfo info in response.Results )
{
    Console.WriteLine( "{0} ({1}): {2}" info.Title, info.ReleaseDate, info.Overview );
}
```

See the [MovieInfo](DM.MovieApi/MovieDb/Movies/MovieInfo.cs) class for all available information from a movie search response.

#### Usage - Examples: Paging a search result
```csharp
var movieApi = MovieDbFactory.Create<IApiMovieRequest>().Value;

int pageNumber = 1;
int totalPages;
do
{
    ApiSearchResponse<MovieInfo> response = await movieApi.SearchByTitleAsync( "Harry", pageNumber );

    // alternatively, just call response.ToString() which will provide the same paged information format as below:
    Console.WriteLine( "Page {0} of {1} ({2} total results)", response.PageNumber, response.TotalPages, response.TotalResults );

    foreach( MovieInfo info in response.Results )
    {
        Console.WriteLine( "{0} ({1}): {2}", info.Title, info.ReleaseDate, info.Overview );
    }

    totalPages = response.TotalPages;
} while( pageNumber++ < totalPages );
```

### Do you have a comprehensive list of examples?
* The API we've exposed should be fairly straight forward. All interfaces, classes, methods, properties, etc... have full intellisense support. If you need more detailed examples, just ask!
* You may also browse the suite of [integration tests](DM.MovieApi.IntegrationTests/) covering all usages of the API.
